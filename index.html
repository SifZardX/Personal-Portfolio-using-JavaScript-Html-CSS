              Birthday Reminder Web App (React, Javascript, html 5, Azure Data

            </strong>
            <p>
              This WebApp reminds its user when the birthdate they stored comes.
              This sends a overhead notification to the user when it's exactly
              12:00 am. This stores user data in a database. Have plans to
              create a android app using android studio and a ios aapp using
              swift. With Paid version for native apps.
